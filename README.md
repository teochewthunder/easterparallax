# Easter-themed Parallax site

When you scroll up and down, the background seems to move. Sometimes it's explicit, as in the JavaScript-controlled elements, and sometimes it's more subtle.

The latter effect is achieved by using *fixed* in the CSS *background* property.

## Note 

This is not a *great* example of a beautiful Parallax Site, but the basic idea is there. Design could be improved on.
